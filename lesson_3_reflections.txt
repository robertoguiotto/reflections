Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I need to share my work with others, both for educational and professional reasons. In particular, sharing the work on GitHub can be very useful for open source projects, since other people can contribute to the project with new branches, etc. 

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date w/ your remote repository?
A: Because I want to be sure to publish only the commits that are both consolidated in terms of quality, and important to the project.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Forks are sort of clone of GitHub repos; they are located on GitHub servers. I will use forks when I nedd to "remix" the code written by someone else.

Clones are copy of GitHub repos that are located in a local machine. I will use clones when I need to edit code on my local machine on my projects, or anyway in other solo projects.

Branches exists only inside a repository (both in a local machine and on GitHub) and are different sequences of commits. I will use branches in order to do bug-fixes or make experimental features
